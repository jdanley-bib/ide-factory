# Spec Delta

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Approval record
`idefactory approve` SHALL write a scoped approval file under `.factory/approvals/` and an entry in `.factory/decisions.md`, and SHALL NOT publish, deploy, or spend. The file SHALL contain the note plus the change, task, source revision, action, approver, issuance, expiry, and policy version. When any scope field is missing, the command SHALL write no approval file and SHALL NOT append `decisions.md`.

#### Scenario: Approve
- **WHEN** approve runs with an id, a note, and every scope field
- **THEN** an approval file containing the note exists and `decisions.md` contains the id

#### Scenario: Incomplete approval
- **WHEN** approve runs with an id and a note and omits a scope field
- **THEN** no approval file is written
- **AND** `decisions.md` gains no entry for that id
