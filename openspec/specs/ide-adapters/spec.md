# ide-adapters Specification

## Purpose
Installs the same factory skills, slash commands, and rules for Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and Claude Code.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Shared command set
The system SHALL install status, plan, build, run, full, and review commands for Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, and Cline.

#### Scenario: Command files
- **WHEN** init finishes
- **THEN** each supported IDE has adapter files for status, plan, build, run, full, and review
- **AND** each command directs the IDE to its corresponding factory skill

#### Scenario: Cline workflow files
- **WHEN** init finishes
- **THEN** `.cline/workflows/` contains `factory-status.md`, `factory-plan.md`, `factory-build.md`, `factory-run.md`, `factory-full.md`, and `factory-review.md`
- **AND** each workflow directs Cline to the same factory skill as the matching Cursor command

### Requirement: No model launcher
Installed factory skills SHALL tell the IDE session to do the work. Installed factory skills and commands SHALL NOT direct the CLI to launch a model process.

#### Scenario: Adapter instructions
- **WHEN** installed factory skills are inspected
- **THEN** they state that the IDE session model does the work
- **AND** installed factory skills and commands contain no instruction for the factory CLI to launch a model

#### Scenario: Cline adapter instructions
- **WHEN** installed Cline skills and Cline workflow commands are inspected
- **THEN** `.cline/skills/factory-coordinator/SKILL.md` states that the IDE session model does the work
- **AND** those Cline files contain no instruction for the factory CLI to launch a model

### Requirement: Narrow activation
The Cursor rule SHALL tell the agent to follow factory skills when the human asks the factory to plan, build, review, or report status, and SHALL tell the agent to stay out of unrelated work.

#### Scenario: Rule file
- **WHEN** `.cursor/rules/factory.mdc` is read
- **THEN** it states that unrelated requests are left alone

### Requirement: Upgrade refreshes adapters only
`idefactory upgrade` SHALL refresh factory-owned adapter files, including the Cline rule, Cline skills, and Cline workflow commands, and SHALL NOT replace an existing decisions log.

#### Scenario: Upgrade keeps decisions
- **WHEN** `decisions.md` has a custom entry and upgrade runs
- **THEN** the custom entry remains

#### Scenario: Upgrade refreshes a Cline skill
- **WHEN** a factory-owned file under `.cline/skills/` has been changed and upgrade runs
- **THEN** that file matches the current factory skill again
- **AND** the custom decisions entry remains

### Requirement: Cline skill copies
The system SHALL install the same factory skill directories under `.cline/skills/` that it installs for the other IDEs.

#### Scenario: Skill directories
- **WHEN** init finishes
- **THEN** `.cline/skills/` contains `factory-coordinator`, `factory-openspec`, `factory-build`, `factory-run`, `factory-full`, `factory-governance`, `factory-tdd`, `factory-verify`, and `factory-debug`
- **AND** each of those directories contains `SKILL.md`

### Requirement: Cline narrow activation
The Cline rule SHALL tell the agent to follow factory skills for factory plan, build, review, or status requests, and SHALL tell the agent to leave unrelated work alone.

#### Scenario: Cline rule file
- **WHEN** `.cline/rules/factory.md` is read
- **THEN** it states that unrelated requests are left alone

### Requirement: Single Cline rule tree
The system SHALL install the factory Cline rule, skills, and workflows only under `.cline/` and SHALL NOT create `.clinerules/`.

#### Scenario: Legacy tree absent
- **WHEN** init finishes in a project that had no `.clinerules/` directory
- **THEN** `.clinerules/` does not exist

### Requirement: No Cline queue
Installing the Cline adapter SHALL NOT create a work queue other than `.factory/work/` and SHALL NOT add a Cline orchestration command.

#### Scenario: Queue stays shared
- **WHEN** init finishes
- **THEN** `.factory/work/index.json` exists
- **AND** `.cline/` does not contain a `work/` directory

### Requirement: Factory pull-request guidance
Installed factory guidance SHALL name `idefactory pr open`, `idefactory pr comment`, and `idefactory pr capture` as the only legal pull-request steps. It SHALL say the agent never merges. It SHALL say `sync-tasks`, `run`, `approve`, `complete`, `verify`, `ci scaffold`, and archive or spec sync run only after the human asks for that action.

#### Scenario: Rule names the legal pull-request steps
- **WHEN** the installed Cursor factory rule is read
- **THEN** it names `pr open`, `pr comment`, and `pr capture` as the only legal pull-request steps
- **AND** it says the agent never merges

#### Scenario: Run guidance waits for the human
- **WHEN** the installed factory-run skill is read
- **THEN** it names `sync-tasks`, `run`, `approve`, `complete`, `verify`, `ci scaffold`, and archive or spec sync as actions that wait for the human
- **AND** it does not name another pull-request command as legal
